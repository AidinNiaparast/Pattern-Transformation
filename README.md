# Pattern-Transformation
Fourth project of the Advanced Programming course taken in Spring 2017

This project's goal is to implement a web-based game using Java, JSP and HTML. In this game, the player should transform a pattern into another one by performing some specific operations. The operations allowed are cyclic shifts of rows and columns of the board.

To run the game as a user, you can run userpanel.jsp in the WebContent directory. To add a new level to the game, you can log in as admin by running adminpanel.jsp in the same directory.
